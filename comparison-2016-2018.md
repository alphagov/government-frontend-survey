### Question 4: What templating languages do you use on this project?

More people are using Nunjucks, this is likely due to the GOV.UK Design System adopting Nunjucks to provide examples.

### Question 8: What frontend resources from GDS does your project use?

One of the aims of the GOV.UK Design System was to merge GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit, Elements and Template into one package to be used, so we’re happy to see a reduced usage of these deprecated libraries.

This year we also see people announce their own departmental resources, which have seen more investment.

#### Answers

### Question 9: How are GOV.UK frontend resources integrated into your project?

In 2016 we saw over 50% (“npm”, “package manager”, “gem”) of people using package managers such as npm, this year we see around the same results but people are announcing npm as their primary package manager.

Gulp has more usage but Webpack is a new introduction, which may tie in with the increased usage of frameworks like React.

We also feel for the people who responded with “Badly”!

| npm | 19.4% | 43.1% |

### Question 10: How do you keep those resources up-to-date in your project?

More people are using npm to keep their dependencies up-to-date, a new addition is “Dependency notification service” why open an issue or pull request on your repository.
