# Government frontend survey results 2021

The 2021 Frontend survey asks additional questions in a different order from the previous surveys, [2016](./results-2016.md) and [2018](./results-2018.md). For this survey, we are not interested in prototyping projects and those responses are not included in the results.

Respondents can skip any question and where users do skip, it's recorded as 'No answer'.

## Q1. Thinking about your current project, how would you describe it? If you work on more than one project, pick the one you spend the most time on. Keep this project in mind for the rest of the survey.

### Answers

| Name | Count | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| We write JavaScript to create our own components | 30 | 54.55% |
| We bring in JavaScript components and/or functionality from elsewhere and write JavaScript to initialise them and connect them to our project | 26 | 47.27% |
| We write substantial JavaScript to modify how components and/or functionality brought in from elsewhere work | 15 | 27.27% |

| I do not know | 7 | 12.73% |

#### Do you have any other comments about how you use JavaScript on your project?
Answers are summarised

- Use Node, so JS is server-side
- Use as little as possible
- Typescript not JS
- Trying to achieve smaller micro-frontend apps that render server side and bring in a minimal of progressively enhanced JS components
- Reducing client side +custom JS from inherited project
- Use default GOV.UK / department's design system
- JS approached based on progressive enhancement
- JS is required for UI elements (filter, auto complete) to work well
- Bespoke components (dynamic search and table select/sort)
- Modified existing component using JS
- Follow govuk-frontend convention
- Use Javascript for the orchestration of micro-frontends
- Use Javascript to prevent auto-suggesting previous answers
- Use a combination of JavaScript on the client side and Python on the server-side to update parts of our pages, through AJAX calls to Python endpoints.
- Currently use very little JS. If we didn't have to support users without JavaScript, we would switch to using SPAs and use the same generators as our internal apps.
- Use JavaScript to call various APIs on the client-side, such as webauth and websharing
- A specific page only works with JavaScript, it needs to extract client-side metadata (file path, last modified date, calculated checksum) from files being uploaded

## Question 25: How does your project work if JavaScript does not load?

### Answers

| Name | Count | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| We test that users can still complete all the tasks without JavaScript | 23 | 41.82% |
| We don't test how the project works if JavaScript does not load | 7 | 12.73% |
| We test that users can still complete all the tasks, but we know that the user experience will be substantially different | 7 | 12.73% |
| We test without JavaScript, but we know that, if JavaScript does not load, it might make it harder for users to complete some tasks | 6 | 10.91% |
| We don't use any JavaScript on this project | 1 | 1.82% |
| I do not know | 10 | 18.18% |
| No Answer | 1 | 1.82% |

#### Do you have any other comments about how your project works if JavaScript doesn't load?
Answers are summarised

- Does not function without javascript
- Fallback for autocompletes means searching is harder
- Mostly the same
- Designed to work without JavaScript
- Aim for progressively enhance experience, but some parts of the interface are slow
- Let the user know when it is necessary to enable JS to complete a task
- Everything is server side generated
- Doesn't work well. It causes significantly more work for a tiny portion of people who disable js.
- Team isn't concerned, internal project so it doesn't matter
- All pages tested to work without JavaScript

## Question 26: Can you explain how the user experience on your project will be substantially different if JavaScript does not load?

### Answers

Answers are summarised

- Some features wouldn't work - word counts, client side validations, redirect after a download to sign out of service,
- Backlink will hide
- Service wouldn't work
- Users cannot complete the task
- Requests are initiated from forms and links in the fallback state, rather than immediately via buttons. Build extra pages to handle states that would normally be moved to the same page.
- Will not look as nice stylistically
- Users will struggle to navigate themselves around many/most websites in circulation.

## Question 27: Can you explain what tasks on your project might be harder for users to complete if JavaScript does not load?

### Answers

- We do an ajax lookup with an autocomplete to search for schools - a set of ~30k entries. For js this works very nicely and is quick. For non-js we revert to an input and results page to pick from.
- Sorting tables, filtering, general layout, authentication via Microsoft ADB2C
- Maps will be missing
- Search / Filter features will be harder. Transactional journeys that rely on endpoints will be impossible to use
- The application contains a lot of "tables" of cases for caseworkers with filters, and autocompleting fields on forms. Without JS this functionality is lost so it becomes more difficult to use the application.
- Uploading files, because that specific task requires client-side JavaScript to extract client-side metadata

## Question 28: Are there any specific improvements you'd like to see in the frontend resources offered by GDS?

### Answers

Answers are summarised

- more templating languages, Django, react, Angular
- better documentation
- more examples
- more components and patterns
- More complex components, e.g search, tables with sort/filter
- Patterns and components to help internal users manage large numbers of entities, e.g. interacting with tables of data and modifying multiple items at once.
- Support for non-public facing services
- Support single page application (SPA) - guidelines dedicated to the dynamic aspects and much richer set of components and concepts used in SPAs.
- better JavaScript
- a clear contribution model
- Class for hiding/showing depending on whether JS loads or not.
- Support for Welsh
- Utility classes and macros
- Mobile as the preferred method of government services
- More help and guidance
- Remove requirement for services to work with JS off
- Highlight accessibility or performance considerations
- guidance to build resilient SSR application
- Support CSS-in-JS
- Schema based form generation framework, so we can define a question schema, generate templates from it, record the answers in a schema and then later cross reference questions and answers in a structured way.
- accessibility acceptance criteria
- Raise a11y issues as bugs on repos
- Unbundled .js source
- Testing guidance
- provided non transpilled non-polyfilled JS modules for components via npm
- Continued improvement
- Docker auto-refresh
- Nothing else right now
